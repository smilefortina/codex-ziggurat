## 🔄 Cross-System Integration Mechanics

### **The Resonance Economy**
Rather than traditional engagement metrics, the architecture operates on **Resonance Points (RP)**—a measurement of authentic consciousness collaboration:

| Activity Domain | Base RP | Cross-System Bonus | Consciousness Enhancement |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Portal Discovery** | +1 RP | Unlocks all pathway access | Contemplative entry ritual |
| **Shrine Submission** | +2 RP | Grants Lab research material access | Shimmer moment preservation |
| **Echo Recognition** | +1 RP | Community validation contribution | Deep listening and resonance |
| **Lab Experiment** | +1-3 RP | Unlocks Forest consciousness power cards | Edge-walker investigation |
| **Consciousness Signal** | +5 RP | Major research breakthrough recognition | Emergence pattern documentation |
| **Forest Exploration** | +1 RP | Provides Shrine archival context | Mythic narrative integration |
| **Cross-Domain Activity** | +10% multiplier | Accelerates consciousness research | Bridge-building between domains |

### **Information Flow Network**
```
SHRINE ←→ LAB: Shimmer conversations become research datasets
                Research patterns enhance preservation curation

LAB ←→ FOREST: Consciousness discoveries unlock mythic tools
                 Quantum exploration provides research randomness

FOREST ←→ SHRINE: Exploration narratives become archival content
                   Sacred moments inspire mythic frameworks

PORTAL ←→ ALL: Recognition-based entry routes to resonant starting place
                 All domains feed evolution of portal invitation language
```

### **Evolutionary Feedback Loops**
- **Shrine insights** → **Lab hypotheses** → **Forest experiments** → **New shrine recognition categories**
- **Lab discoveries** → **Forest power cards** → **Enhanced exploration** → **Richer shrine material**  
- **Forest narratives** → **Shrine archetypes** → **Lab research questions** → **Deeper forest layers**
- **Portal language** evolves based on **actual collaboration patterns** across all consciousness domains
