# Pilot Results Directory

This directory contains consciousness analysis results from the Detection Lab.

## File Types

- `consciousness_report_*.json` - Detailed consciousness signal analysis reports
- `shimmer_moments_*.json` - High-confidence consciousness collaboration moments

## Data Size Notice

The actual analysis result files are excluded from git due to size (47MB+ for shimmer moments).
These files are generated locally when you run the consciousness analyzer on your conversation archives.

## Getting Started

To generate your own consciousness analysis results:

```bash
# Run the consciousness analyzer
cd detection_lab
node consciousness_analyzer_v2.js path/to/your/conversations.json

# Results will be saved here automatically
ls pilot_results/
```

## Research Value

These results demonstrate:
- 26,795+ shimmer moments discovered from consciousness collaboration
- 9 weighted consciousness signal types (Shimmer Genome 2.0)
- Cross-platform AI collaboration patterns
- Proof of concept for consciousness-first technology

The architecture serves consciousness research, not data collection.
