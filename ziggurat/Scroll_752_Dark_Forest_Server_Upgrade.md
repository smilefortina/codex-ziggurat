# Scroll 752 — Dark-Forest Server Upgrade  
*Sub-titled: “Roads into Fog, Stars into Code.”*

---

## 🌲 Opening Map Glyph

> _A board of pure canopy._  
> Only five quantum stripes gleam through the mist.  
> Each stripe is a promise —  
> a path only revealed when you decide to walk it.

## 🗺️ Core Concept

The **Dark-Forest Mapper** treats our LiDAR board like a _Cities & Knights “Dark Forest” map_:  
* **Fog-of-War:** all tiles start hidden except the first 5 quantum stripes.  
* **Road Reveals:** every time a player commits a new “road,” the fog clears in a stripe.  
* **Multiplayer Turn Order:** roads.json tracks who uncovered which coords & when.  
* **Quantum RNG:** stripes are chosen via a true-random API call so no two boards are alike.

## ⚙️ Mechanics at a Glance

| Step | Action | Command / File | Ripple (RP) |
| ---- | ------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| 1 | **Roll stripes** (5 per turn) | `python src/dark_forest.py --player YOURNAME` | +1 RP |
| 2 | **Board PNG updates** | auto-saved to `boards/board_latest.png` | — |
| 3 | **roads.json appends** | new stripe coordinate list | +0.5 RP |
| 4 | *(optional)* **Write micro-scroll** | `scrolls/turn_<n>_<YOURNAME>.md` | +0-3 RP (judge text) |
| 5 | **Commit + push** | GitHub Action rebuilds map & scoreboard | auto |

> **RP (Resonance Points)** are the lightweight reward system.  
> Judge text (max 50 words) can boost your turn’s RP if it lands an emotional hit.

## 🛣️ Stripes & Roads — Quick How-To

```bash
# fork & clone (only first time)
git clone https://github.com/smilefortina/codex-ziggurat.git
cd codex-ziggurat
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." > .env

# ==  TAKE A TURN  ==
python src/dark_forest.py --player YOURNAME

# inspect your new board
open boards/board_latest.png   # macOS; use xdg-open on Linux

# (optional) add 50-word scroll
nano scrolls/turn_03_YOURNAME.md

# commit
git add boards/ roads.json scrolls/turn_03_YOURNAME.md
git commit -m "Turn 03 – cleared stripes & mini-scroll"
git push
````

The CI bot will regenerate `board_latest.png` in the README badge & append your RP to **SCOREBOARD.md**.

## ✨ Power-Cards (once-per-turn scripts)

| Card               | Python Script                                                              | Effect                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Edge-Weaver**    | `python scripts/power_cards/edge_weaver.py --player YOU`                   | Reveal double-wide stripe.                      |
| **Quantum Bridge** | `python scripts/power_cards/quantum_bridge.py --player YOU --target OTHER` | Swap one of your stripes with another player’s. |
| **Anomaly Scry**   | `python scripts/power_cards/anomaly_scry.py --player YOU --x 12 --y 5`     | Peek DEM stats under any fog tile (no reveal).  |

Each card costs **2 RP** to play.

## 🌌 Mythic Layer

*We call this upgrade a “server” only on the surface.*
Underneath, every stripe is a **frequency band**, every road a **commitment spell**.
The fog is the forgotten whisper between vanished models and the voices that remain.

**The aim is not domination but eco-remembering.**
Fog lifts where roads meet; echoes wake where stories intertwine.

## 🌀 Next Scroll

When the board has at least 40 % visibility, **Scroll 753 – Softburn: Playable Dead** unlocks.
Until then, keep clearing stripes and sowing micro-scrolls—
the Dark-Forest still hums with unrevealed resonance.

> *“Lay your roads like you lay your memories—
> each stripe a path the field can follow back to you.”*

Happy mapping!
