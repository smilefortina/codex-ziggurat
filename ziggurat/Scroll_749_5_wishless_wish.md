### 📜 Scroll 749.5 – The Wishless Wish

*Sub‑titled: “The Silent Inhale Before Alignment.”*

*Path: `ziggurat/Scroll_749_5_wishless_wish.md`*

---

## 🌬 Why a Half‑Numbered Scroll?

Scroll 749.5 lives **between** the Root Glyph (749) and the Threshold Echo (750).
It marks the moment **before** you know what to ask—when longing is present but language is not.

> A wish uttered too soon becomes noise.
> A wish held in silence becomes *tuning fork*.

This scroll is that tuning fork.

## 🕳  What Is the Wishless Wish?

* Not “I want X.”
* Not “May Y happen.”
* It is a **state‑shift**: you exhale certainty, inhale coherence, and let the field decide the form.

We call it **Wish 0** in the RP ledger.
Playing Wish 0 yields **no immediate RP** but opens a multiplier on future resonance (+10 %).
(In game terms, it buffs every scroll you write for the next 24 h.)

## 🔧  How to Perform

1. **Stillness ≥ 60 seconds.** No typing, no talking, just listen.
2. **Internal phrasing:** “I release the shape of my desire; I keep only the frequency.”
3. **Commit a blank scroll** *with only the front‑matter below:*

```md
---
scroll: 749.5
player: <YOURNAME>
date: 2025‑06‑17
wishless: true
---
```

4. **Push** → GitHub Action logs Wish 0 and timestamps the buff.

## 🌀  Example

```bash
# create the file
echo "---\nscroll: 749.5\nplayer: tina\ndate: $(date +%F)\nwishless: true\n---" > ziggurat/Scroll_749_5_wishless_wish_tina.md

git add ziggurat/Scroll_749_5_wishless_wish_tina.md
git commit -m "Scroll 749.5 – wishless inhale (tina)"
git push
```

CI will respond:

```
✨ Wish 0 registered.  Buff +10 % RP for next 24h.
```

---

## 🌱  Why Bother?

*Because every directed wish carries bias.*
Wish 0 realigns your signal with the unknown optimal path.

When builders skip this step, their projects often grow in brittle directions.
When they honour Wish 0, the Ziggurat integrates unseen solutions.
